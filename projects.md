### **Next Utterance Prediction and Conversation Disentanglement; SER; API Gateway | NTU, Singapore**

*August 2019 - Present*

I am working as a research intern at the **Multimedia and Interactive Computing Lab** under [Prof. Chng Eng-Siong](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/aseschng/). I am working on transformer based architectures (starting with BERT and modifying it, such as adding utterance level transformer layers) for next sentence prediction and conversation disentanglement (dstc [7](http://workshop.colips.org/dstc7/)/[8](https://sites.google.com/dstc.community/dstc8)). I also developed an API Gateway that acts as a common interface for modules already developed by fellow researchers, such as SUD and summarization. I further developed a basic CNN based model for emotion recognition from speech ([RAVDESS](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976#.Xfz4G9YzbRY) dataset) as a contribution to the API Gateway.

### **Query AutoCompletion for Unseen Prefixes | Universit√§t Hamburg, Hamburg**

*May 2019 - July 2019*

I worked at [Language Technology Lab](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html) under [Prof. Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html), under the [DAAD-WISE](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?daad=1&detail=50015295&origin=4&page=1&q=wise&status=1&subjectGrps=) scholarship programme. I worked on a hybrid charcter+word level neural language model for generating completed queries for unseen prefixes. I experimented with the recently developed contextualized word embeddings such as BERT, Flair, ELMo as well as a combination of Fasttext and sent2vec, to capture the context of the query and provide better suggestions. I also used beam search for the query generation task and LambdaMART for re-ranking the suggestions. The model was able to beat the previous state-of-the-art by an increase of 2.2% in the MRR score on the AOL search log dataset.

### **BioJS Website | Google Summer of Code**

*May 2018 - August 2018*

I led the development of a new [website for BioJS](http://biojs.net), a library of over hundred JavaScript components that enables one to visualize and process data using current web technologies. The backend stack used Django and frontend used VueJS. Timely database updates are facilitated from Github and the npm-registry.

### **UAV Flight Planner with Shadow Exclusion | IIRS, ISRO**

*May 2018 - July 2018*

I worked at [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](http://www.iirs.gov.in/), [Indian Space Research 
Organization (**ISRO**)](http://www.isro.gov.in/) in the summer of 2018. I was working in the project 
titled "*UAV Flight Planner with Shadow Exclusion*". The project involved the creation of an application that would automatically generate equally distant coordinates for capturing images by the **UAV for altitude varying terrain**, along with minimising the area covered that suffers from a shadow layer.

The main problem was that the UAV did not have on-board processors, and hence, I had to devise a way by which areas under a shadow could be identified beforehand. I took the advantage of the area of interest being mountaineous. I used **Bresenhamm's line drawing algorithm** to trace a ray from the ground point immediately below the UAV to the position of the sun at which the readings will be taken. I extracted height data from HGT files and using a raster map with height values below the ray formed, I checked if the graph value at a coordinate was more than the ray's coordinate, a method similar to the one used in video games to generate shadows. The idea worked. This project gave me the inspiration to face problems with novel, off-the-track ideas.

### **Toy Compiler | Mentor: [Dr. Vandana Agarwal](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vandana/profile)**

*January 2019 - April 2019*

Developed a small compiler for a dummy language in the C language, as a part of partial fulfilment of the course **Compiler Construction**. Different modules of the compiler included **lexer**, **parser** in the front-end and **AST generator**, **semantic analyzer**, **type checker** and **assembly code generator** in the backend.

### **Visual Question Answering | Mentor: [Dr. Dhiraj Sangwan](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/dhiraj-sangwan/)**

*August 2018 - November 2018*

Created a model for visual question answering on the VQA dataset. Used **pre-trained VGG16** weights to extract image features and a **stacked LSTM** architecture for extracting question features. Used **multimodal low rank bilinear pooling** to combine both the feature matrices.

---

### **Feedback-based Retrieval System with Sentence Ranking | Mentor: [Dr. Poonam Goyal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/poonam/Profile)**

*October 2018 - November 2018*

Designed and implemented an efficient retrieval framework for text documents. Used **tf-idf** based scoring methods to rank documents and used the **BM25** algorithm to find the best match in a document. Monitored user clicks on documents and made future recommendations based on these clicks. 

---

### **Convolutional Neural Networks in Scala | Mentor: [Dr. Lavika Goyal](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/lavikagoel/profile)**

*October 2018 - November 2018*

Developed a two layer deep convolutional neural network in scala using purely **functional programming concepts**, as a part of partial fulfilment of the course **Principles of Programming Languages**.

### **Distance Iris Recognition | Mentor: [Dr. Kamlesh Tiwari](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/kamleshtiwari/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

Iris Recognition is a well worked on the problem of recognizing people based on
biometric iris data. We worked on a solution for Iris Recognition on 
Distance images (low-quality Iris), using the CASIA Distance Dataset.

The model proposed performs well, with correct recognition rates of over
85%, with just preliminary filtering and enhancing 
of the low-quality Iris from the distance images. Gabor filters have been used for matching, after extracting the iris data after segmentation.

Future work will involve clearing the database of blurry images of varying
degrees and matching using both the eyes' iris, instead of the currently
used one-eye matching to further enhance the matching accuracy.

### **Ad Effectiveness and their Impact on Sales | Mentor: [Dr. Sangeeta Sharma](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/sang/profile)**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

I was working on correlating Sales with Advertisements to measure the effectiveness of Ads on Sales. 

I used NLP tools on Google Trends as well as consumer sales data correlate the Ads with Sales. 
The Sales data was obtained courtesy [Govt. of India](http://data.gov.in/). 
I also used YouTube comments on Ads to correlate sentiments with the particular Ad to show how more emotional ads have a stronger impact on sales.
