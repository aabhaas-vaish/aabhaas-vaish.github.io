## About Me

Hi! I am Aabhaas. I am a final year undergraduate student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani), majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am broadly interested in the applications of Deep Learning, specifically in the fields of Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

As an undergraduate student, I had the pleasure of working as a research intern with [Prof Bernhard Riecke](http://ispace.iat.sfu.ca/riecke/) at the [iSpace Lab](http://ispace.iat.sfu.ca/) in [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/), through the [MITACS Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) program. Through this internship, I got the opportunity to work on emotional state recognition using EEG signals through several deep learning based methods such as LSTM Networks, Multi-Layer Perceptrons, hybrid CNN-RNN Networks, and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs).

After my sophomore year, I was also fortunate to get the opportunity to intern at the [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](https://www.iirs.gov.in/), a research centre of [Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/) where I worked on tracking and detecting vehicles in video feeds using computer vision methods such as RCNN, YOLO, and SSD.

While my primary research interests lie in the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence, I also enjoy learning about the advances made in Distributed Computing and IoT which led to this paper on the [Industrial Applications of Edge and Fog Computing!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00595)

I most recently worked as a research intern under [Prof. Chng Eng-Siong](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/aseschng/) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) as part of my bachelor thesis. I focused on improving the diversity of text generation models, particularly for dialogues and chit-chat. I also worked on a production ready API gateway for various modules already developed at the lab, such as SUD, NER and summarization. For the gateway, I also made a simple CNN architecture to detect emotion from speech.

I previously worked under [Prof. Chris Biemann](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html) at the [Language Technology Lab](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/home.html) in [Universität Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html), as a scholar of the [DAAD-WISE](https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/?daad=1&detail=50015295&origin=4&page=1&q=wise&status=1&subjectGrps=) scholarship. I worked on query-autocompletion for unseen prefixes, mostly experimenting with using contextualized embeddings to better capture the sense. Details can be found in my résumé/CV or under the projects section. 

In my sophomore year, I was lucky to get selected for [Google Summer of Code, 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/projects/6278298501906432/) as a part of the amazing [BioJS](biojs.net) community. I was mentored by [Rowland Mosbergen](https://twitter.com/rowlandm?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor), [Yo Yehudi](http://yo-yehudi.com/) and [Dennis Schwartz](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/dennis-schwartz-093315b3). 

I also interned at [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](https://www.iirs.gov.in/), a research centre of [Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/), where I worked on a flight planning software for a UAV.

I am a huge fan of travelling, mostly travelling cheap and light. I was able to travel 21 countries before I turned 21 years old (Nov 19)! I am also a huge fan of electronic music, having attended [Tomorrowland, 2019](http://tomorrowland.com) and [Airbeat One, 2019](http://www.airbeat-one.de)!!!

## Research Interest

My research interests primarily lie in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as their applications. I am fascinated by the **human language** and pretty much everything related to it, though I am slightly inclined towards researching on language as a tool for **human-computer interaction** and that sparks my interest in **dialogue systems and question answering models**. I have also developed an interest in **multimodal learning**, researching at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision.
