## About Me
<img class="profile-picture" src="av_new.jpg">
Hi! I am Aabhaas. I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, majoring in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am broadly interested in the applications of Deep Learning, specifically in the fields of Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and Natural Language Processing.

As an undergraduate student, I was fortunate to get the opportunity to work as a research intern with [Prof Bernhard Riecke](http://ispace.iat.sfu.ca/riecke/) at the [iSpace Lab](http://ispace.iat.sfu.ca/) in [Simon Fraser University](http://www.sfu.ca/), through the [MITACS Globalink Research Internship](https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship) program. I got the opportunity to work on emotional state recognition using EEG signals through several deep learning based methods such as LSTM Networks, hybrid CNN-RNN Networks, and Deep Belief Networks.

After my sophomore year, I also got the opportunity to intern at the [Indian Institute of Remote Sensing](https://www.iirs.gov.in/), a research centre of [Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)](https://www.isro.gov.in/) where I worked on tracking and detecting vehicles in video feeds using computer vision methods such as RCNN, YOLO, and SSD.

While my primary research interests lie in the domain of machine learning and artificial intelligence, I also enjoy learning about the advances made in Distributed Computing and IoT which led to this paper on the [Industrial Applications of Edge and Fog Computing!](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00595)

## Research Interest

My research interests primarily lie in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as their applications. I am fascinated by the **human language** and pretty much everything related to it, though I am slightly inclined towards researching on language as a tool for **human-computer interaction** and that sparks my interest in **dialogue systems and question answering models**. I have also developed an interest in **multimodal learning**, researching at the intersection of natural language processing and computer vision.
